# **TerminalRaid**
**TerminalRaid** is a CLI command based Cybersecurity Multiplayer Game that updates in real time. 

## Overview

Your objective is to track down other players and hack them to obtain resources. All of this knowing that YOU can be hacked as well. Using technologies such as:

- **Networking:** Real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) communication.
- **Cryptography:** Make encryption algorithms and break other's algorithms.
- **Cybersecurity emulation:** Hacking mechanisms that simulate real-life attacks and defenses.
- **Idle Resource gathering:** In this game, you enhance/upgrade your mechanisms with better hardware. Which is bought with RaidTokens (RTK), a fictional Cryptocurrency that is gained through time dependent mechanisms that simulate how Cryptocurrency mining works (More in-depth explanation later).
- **Web game:** play the game without installing anything through a GitHub site.

Players can hack anyone who has a vulnerability that can be exploited with obtained algorithms and hardware. All of this through integrated commands
